* The Circular Band symbolises the school's commitment to an all-round education.
*   The Book with its pages open signifies the school as an institution that emphasizes learning as continuous process.
*   The pages and the spine of the book take the form of a burning torch that signifies the passing on of knowledge, values and habits.
*   The Arrows show the way to Excellence through Discipline and Diligence.
*   The Colour apple-green is symbolic of vitality, blue signifies graciousness, gold represents excellence, and flaming yellow stands for commitment.
