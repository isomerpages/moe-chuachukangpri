<p>Chua Chu Kang Primary School (CCKPS) started operations in 1994. Today,
our school has grown to be a reputable school of choice in the community.
I am both humbled and privileged to be entrusted with the honour of leading
CCKPS.</p>
<p>Our school philosophy - ‘Every child can learn; every child can lead’
- is a powerful one which propels our every thought and action. We will
hold that unwavering belief in each and every child, as we help him/her
to uncover his/her passion and develop to his/her fullest potential. We
will continually strive to be committed to our mission to ‘bring out the
best in every child’.</p>
<p>We will stay true to our vision of “Empowered Leaders” as we continue
to nurture our students to be Confident, Creative and Competent individuals
through quality learning.&nbsp; In our effort to ensure that our differentiated
programmes cater to student needs, the school has embarked on various innovation
projects, while leveraging on technology and inculcation of thinking skills
into the curriculum. Some of our curriculum innovations include AFaL (Assessment
For all Learners), our Applied Learning Programme (Robotics) and our Learning
for Life Programme (anchored upon Stephen Covey’s 7 Habits).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>A unique feature of our values education is the Growth Mindset (GM) and
the “Four Powers”:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>The power of <strong>yet</strong>: <em>You can do anything if you put your mind to it</em>
<br>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The power of <strong>choice</strong>: <em>Make the right decisions and be responsible for your own learning</em>
<br>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The power of <strong>feedback</strong>: <em>This is a gift to help us grow</em>
<br>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The power of <strong>mistakes</strong>: <em>Mistakes hold the real key to resilience and learning</em>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Our school also focuses on Character and Citizenship Education (CCE),
aesthetics appreciation and physical education to develop our students
holistically. We design meaningful VIA programmes to help our students
internalise school values through authentic and experiential learning,
and these efforts are enhanced through collaboration with our community
and industrial partners.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As we move into a season of refinement and deepening, I am exceedingly
grateful to my predecessors who have led the school, staff, partners and
stakeholders who have built up CCKPS together with us. The past 7 years
of steadfast effort and authentic conversations, guided by our theme of
‘Gratitude and Growth’ have reaped positive outcomes for the school, and
I am excited to continue this journey with a new theme of “Transformation”
for our next lap.</p>
<p>Guided by our motto ‘Excellence through Discipline and Diligence’, we
will continue to be relentless in our mission of growing the next generation,
and bring CCKPS to greater heights.</p>
<p>
<br>With gratitude,</p>
<p>Mrs Sheree Chong
<br>Principal</p>
