Chua Chu Kang Primary School (CCKPS) started operations in 1994. Today, our school has grown to be a reputable school of choice in the community. I am both humbled and privileged to be entrusted with the honour of leading CCKPS.

Our school philosophy - ‘We believe that every child is special’ - is a powerful one which propels our every thought and action. We will hold that unwavering belief in each and every child, as we help him/her to uncover his/her passion and develop to his/her fullest potential. We will continually strive to be committed to our mission to ‘bring out the best in every child’.

We will stay true to our vision of “Empowered Leaders" as we continue to nurture our students to be Confident, Creative and Competent individuals. Based on Stephen Covey’s ‘7 Habits of Highly Effective People’, our programme for Personal and Social Effectiveness (PSE) has been a cornerstone in every student’s journey of character development in CCKPS. 

In engaging our young learners, we focus on quality learning experiences and outcomes. This is done through curriculum innovations, leveraging on technology, inculcation of thinking skills and the inclusion of differentiated programmes to cater to student needs. Some of our curriculum innovations include AFaL (Assessment For all Learners), our Talent Development Programme (TDP), our Applied Learning Programme (Robotics) and our Learning for Life Programme (Leading Through C.A.R.E. which is anchored upon Stephen Covey’s 7 Habits).  

Besides the academic domain, our school also focuses on Character and Citizenship Education (CCE), aesthetics appreciation and physical education to develop our students holistically. We design meaningful VIA programmes to help our students internalise school values through authentic learning. This has also enabled us to reach out to the community. 

As we move into a season of refinement and deepening, I am exceedingly grateful to my predecessors who have led the school, staff, partners and stakeholders who have built up CCKPS together with us. The past 3 years of steadfast effort and authentic conversations, guided by our theme of ‘Gratitude and Growth’ have reaped positive outcomes for the school, and I am excited to continue this journey into our next lap.

Guided by our motto ‘Excellence through Discipline and Diligence’, we will continue to be relentless in our mission of growing the next generation, and bring CCKPS to greater heights.

With gratitude,

Mrs Sheree Chong   
Principal
