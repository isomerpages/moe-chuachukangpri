<p>As we step into 2026, brimming with possibilities and aspirations, I am
filled with excitement and a deep sense of humility and gratitude for the
journey ahead with Chua Chu Kang Primary School (CCKPS). Together, we will
embark on a purposeful pursuit of excellence, growth, and meaningful connections
for every child entrusted to our care.</p>
<p>My heartfelt thanks go to my predecessor, Mrs Chong, for her exceptional
leadership and boundless devotion. She has shaped a school that is academically
strong yet wonderfully warm; a place where joy is palpable, values are
lived, and every child feels truly seen and cherished. CCKPS today is a
close-knit community grounded in respect, care, and an unshakable belief
in the unique potential of every student. It is an extraordinary privilege
to build on this beautiful legacy.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, <strong>student agency</strong> will remain at the very heart
of who we are and all we do. Through the learning experiences, every child
will be empowered to learn their strengths, take ownership of their learning,
and make responsible choices daily. This growing sense of agency will equip
them to adapt confidently to change, bounce back with resilience when faced
with setbacks, think critically, communicate clearly, and collaborate effectively.
Most importantly, it will guide their journey to think more about, uplift
and help others: hearts that care deeply for others, hands that serve willingly,
and lives that lead with empathy and purpose.</p>
<p>As this new year unfolds, I am filled with hope and optimism for the moments
of discovery, friendship, and growth that await us. To every student, staff
member, parent, and partner in CCKPS – thank you for your trust and partnership.
Let us walk hand in hand, nurturing every child from strength to strength.</p>
<p>Wishing every member of the CCKPS a wonderful year ahead filled with good
health, shared successes, and abundant happiness.</p>
