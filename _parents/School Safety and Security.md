<h3><u>Management of Traffic Situation</u></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The main entry and exit points of the school are Gate 1 and Gate 4.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Drop-off and Pick-up: All parents who need to drive into the school to
drop-off/pick-up students will be issued with a vehicle entry permit for
easy identification and will only be allowed to drive in on School Terms
during the following timings:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Mass Arrival - 6.15am to 7.30am (Daily)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mass Dismissal - 1.45pm to 2.00pm (Daily)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>To ensure the safety of the school community, parents who drive your child
to school, please take note of the following:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Reduce vehicle speed to <u>no more than 15 km/h</u> and stay alert for pedestrians
in the school zone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you drive your child to school in the morning, please drop him/her
at the <u>school porch</u>. Refrain from parking and alighting from your
vehicle, as this causes traffic congestion in the morning. Please also
refrain from dropping children off along CCK Ave 2, especially in the yellow
box, as this causes inconvenience to other public road users. More importantly,
it is not safe for your child.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Parking in school while waiting for child after school hours is <u>not allowed</u> for
security reasons.&nbsp; In order to ensure there is no unauthorised entry,
please help us keep the school compound safe by not driving in after school
hours.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As a security measure, CCKPS has implemented the car decal for ease of
identifying authorised vehicles when gaining entry to our school compound.&nbsp;
Parents who are dropping off students at the foyer in the morning should
request a decal to be displayed on the windscreen. This drop-off arrangement
is allowed only in the morning and at dismissal, and during term time only.&nbsp;
Vehicles without CCKPS decal may be refused entry into school even for
drop-off in the morning. Please access this link <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://go.gov.sg/carparkdecal</a> for
the request of a decal.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><u>Visitor Parking</u></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>For the safety and security of our students and staff, all unauthorised
vehicles will not be allowed entry into the school premises.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Parents and other visitors on official visit to the school may park in
visitor lots, marked in white, subject to availability.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>During inclement weather, parents will be allowed to drop-off / pick-up
from school regardless of time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All visitors will be issued with Visitor Pass/Coloured stickers during
registration at the Guard Post. These must be worn at all times while in
the school premises for easy identification.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><u>Visitors to the School</u></h3>
<p>Visitors/contractors/vendors/volunteers are to report to the Security
Guard Post to sign-in and a Visitor Pass will be issued for easy identification
by the school staff.&nbsp; The Visitor Pass <strong>must be prominently displayed</strong> on
the external parties while in the school premises.&nbsp; They are to report
to the General Office regardless of the official reasons for their visit
and they should not move beyond the General Office, unless accompanied
by school staff. Parents are strongly encouraged to make prior appointments
with teachers before coming to the school as teachers are likely to be
engaged during the school hours.</p>

<h3><u>Social Responsibility</u></h3>
<p></p>
<p><u>Unwell Students</u>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>If a student is unwell and needs to be sent home early, parent should
fetch their child from school and seek medical attention if necessary.
Please keep the Form Teacher updated on your child's well-being after a
medical consultation. Every student should have a stand-by mask for use
if he/she suddenly feels unwell in school. As part of our collective social
responsibility, we request that parents keep their child at home if they
are unwell, to protect the well-being of other students and staff. Together,
we can create a healthy and safe environment for every student and staff
in our school.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><u>Thermometer</u>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Every student is to ensure that he/she has a working thermometer in his/her
pencil case and brought to school every day. This is to educate students
to take personal responsibility for their own health and practice social
responsibility. Your child has to take his/her temperature before the start
of the school day when he/she feels unwell or during an outbreak. Please
remind your child to check and replace batteries or purchase a new thermometer
if necessary. There will be a yearly Attendance and Temperature-Taking
Exercise conducted. This is to maintain schools' preparedness to re-activate
the attendance and temperature-taking regime should there be a need to.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><u>Personal Hygiene</u>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Students are expected to take charge of their own personal hygiene and
health. We would like to work together with parents to impress upon the
children the importance of washing their hands with soap and water before
meals. Where tap water is unavailable, students are encouraged to use their
personal hand sanitiser to keep their hands clean.</p>
</li>
</ul>
