<h3>SLS Instruction Manual for Parents</h3>
<p>As part of its commitment to nurturing future-ready learners, the Ministry
of Education announced that all students in Singapore schools will be supported
in their learning by the Singapore Student Learning Space (SLS), an online
learning platform that contains curriculum-aligned resources and learning
tools.</p>
<p>With the SLS, students will be able to learn better through the use of
technology. Students will be able to learn anytime, anywhere, and at their
own pace, whether independently or with their peers. Teachers will also
be able to use the SLS to complement their classroom teaching, further
enriching students’ learning experience. We believe such a learning experience
is essential to help your child to become an active and confident user
of technology.</p>
<p>The Singapore Student Learning Space (SLS) is accessible through the internet
browsers on either Windows PC, Mac, iPad or Android tablets (with screen
size larger than 7 inches for good user experience). However, the system
is currently not optimised for use on these devices.</p>

<h3><strong>Student's Username &amp; Password</strong></h3>
<p>Your username&nbsp; is actually made up of your name and BC number. It
is first five characters of your official name and last four numerical
digits and the last alphabet of your BC.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For eg. Student's name is JOHN TAN and BC number is T1002345A, then your
SLS username will be JOHNT2345A</p>
<p>For first time login, use the following default password: (Class + cckps2019)</p>
<p>E.g, if your child is from 4IN2, the default password is 42cckps2019 or
42Cckps2019.</p>
<p>Do ask your child to see if they changed their password. They have been
instructed to write it down into their Pupil’s Companion.</p>
