##### **How do we help our students to think critically?**

To help our students to be critical thinkers, we have adopted the following thinking routines in our Art & Music lessons.

<center><strong><u>Thinking Routines</u></strong></center>

![](/images/aestheticstp.png)

This routine encourages/helps students to:

1. Make careful observations
2. Think critically and make thoughtful interpretations
3. Stimulate curiosity
4. Inquire about what they have observed
5. Find a connection with what they already know


Applying various thinking routines help students to share their thought process at each step before moving on to the next. This allows the class to layer upon each other’s ideas or scaffold their thought process, thus stimulating more in-depth discussions and infusing creativity and problem-solving skills.  

  

  

##### **Thinking Routines for Music** 

**1. Experience – Content – Apply (ECA) approach for lower primary**

ECA approach mainly allows students to experience and perceive a new concept through kinaesthetic, aural and visual activities first before teaching it to them. These stimulus-based activities help the students to have a better grasp when a new concept is being taught as they were able to relate to it, making sense of what they have learnt. After they have understood what was taught, the application phase allows students to apply the new concept, reinforcing their understanding. Through the ECA approach, students develop critical and creative thinking when transferring their knowledge effectively on their own in the application phase. 

  

**2.       Creative cycle for upper primary**

The Creative Cycle is a thinking process that helps students to constantly reflect and evaluate their own performance/s or practice, constantly seeking ways to improve.  They identify the problem using their pre-requisite knowledge, then infuse creativity to solve it. Each time when they practice/play, improvement must be made. This form of deliberate practice trains them to be involved in their own self-assessment and take ownership in their own learning. The teacher’s role is to help facilitate and provide feedback to guide them, helping them with various practicing strategies.
