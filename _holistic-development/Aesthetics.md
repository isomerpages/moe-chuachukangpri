<h5><strong>How do we help our students to think critically?</strong></h5>
<p>To help our students to be critical thinkers, we have adopted the following
thinking routines in our Art &amp; Music lessons.</p>
<p><strong><u>Thinking Routines</u></strong>
</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/aestheticstp.png">
</div>
<p>This routine encourages/helps students to:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Make careful observations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Think critically and make thoughtful interpretations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stimulate curiosity</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inquire about what they have observed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Find a connection with what they already know</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Applying various thinking routines help students to share their thought
process at each step before moving on to the next. This allows the class
to layer upon each other’s ideas or scaffold their thought process, thus
stimulating more in-depth discussions and infusing creativity and problem-solving
skills.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h5><strong>Thinking Routines for Music</strong>&nbsp;</h5>
<p><strong>1. Experience – Content – Apply (ECA) approach for lower primary</strong>
</p>
<p>ECA approach mainly allows students to experience and perceive a new concept
through kinaesthetic, aural and visual activities first before teaching
it to them. These stimulus-based activities help the students to have a
better grasp when a new concept is being taught as they were able to relate
to it, making sense of what they have learnt. After they have understood
what was taught, the application phase allows students to apply the new
concept, reinforcing their understanding. Through the ECA approach, students
develop critical and creative thinking when transferring their knowledge
effectively on their own in the application phase.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Creative cycle for upper primary</strong>
</p>
<p>The Creative Cycle is a thinking process that helps students to constantly
reflect and evaluate their own performance/s or practice, constantly seeking
ways to improve.&nbsp; They identify the problem using their pre-requisite
knowledge, then infuse creativity to solve it. Each time when they practice/play,
improvement must be made. This form of deliberate practice trains them
to be involved in their own self-assessment and take ownership in their
own learning. The teacher’s role is to help facilitate and provide feedback
to guide them, helping them with various practicing strategies.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
