<h3><strong><u>Curriculum Framework</u></strong></h3>
<p>The English Language instructional programmes in the classroom are aligned
with the principles of language learning and teaching in the EL Syllabus.&nbsp;&nbsp;STELLAR
(Strategies for English Language Learning and Reading) is an EL instructional
programme that provides the instructional materials, teaching strategies
and training to enable teachers to implement the EL syllabus. Adopted at
all levels in CCKPS, this approach aims to strengthen the teaching of English
Language through a balanced combination of explicit instruction in language
skills, including grammar and phonics, and the use of age-appropriate literacy-rich
experiences.</p>
<p>Students’ language use is reflected in the following areas of language
learning:</p>

<h3><strong><u>Reading Programme</u></strong></h3>
<p><strong><u>Vision: Every student in CCKPS is a conscientious and engaged reader</u></strong>
</p>
<p>At CCKPS, we hope to develop every student into a conscientious and engaged
reader. Our Reading Programme is conducted through various platforms to
inculcate the love for reading and to improve the literacy level of our
students.</p>
<p><strong><u>Reading Passports and Avid Readers</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Reading Passports provide students with the opportunity to immerse themselves
in activities related to reading such as character exploration and introduction
to various genres or authors. We also encourage students to read regularly
by acknowledging the top readers from each level through the termly Avid
Reader Awards.</p>
<p><strong><u>Read for Books</u></strong>
</p>
<p>In addition to encouraging students to read actively, we offer a platform
for both students and staff to read for a good cause and share their love
for reading with others. Riding on the National Library Board (NLB)’s Read
for Books campaign, students and staff play their part for the community
by simply taking part in a collective reading session of 15 minutes. This
is done anywhere in the school in the month of July. For every 10 individuals
who read for 15 minutes, one book will be donated to selected beneficiaries.
Our Media Resource Library supports this initiative by setting up the Mobile
Library @ The Canteen.</p>

<p><strong><u>Book Bugs</u></strong>
</p>
<p>CCKPS has implemented NLB’s Book Bugs: School Edition programme. It is
a collectible card game reading promotion for children by NLB that enhances
students’ reading experience not just at NLB but at CCKPS. Book Buzz talks
by NLB are held to encourage our students to participate in the Book Bugs
campaign and to read widely.</p>

<p>To support the school’s Reading Programme, Reading Reps and Leaders are
trained to promote reading to their peers by sharing selected books and
creating an inviting class library.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><u>Book Character Parade (Media Resource Library Programme)</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Media Resource Library (MRL) in CCKPS aims to promote the love for reading
among our students and provide them the opportunities to develop the knowledge
and skills necessary to access library resources. To enhance the joy of
learning, students are also introduced to different themes and genre of
books. Our MRL holds Book Character Parade for our students yearly during
the Library Week. Primary 1 to Primary 4 students will dress up as book
characters to celebrate the magic of literature in a fun and creative way.
By stepping into the shoes of their favourite characters, students not
only express their love for stories but also gain a deeper understanding
of their characters’ personalities, challenges and triumphs. Our Book Character
Parade foster imagination, encourage reading and spark conversations about
the books that inspire our students.</p>
