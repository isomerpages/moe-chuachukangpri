#### Reading Programme
Our Reading programme is carried out in all classes to encourage students to read actively so as to improve the literacy level of our students and to inculcate the love of reading. Through this programme, students are provided with storybooks and are introduced to various authors and genres. 

As part of this programme we have Reading Ambassadors who are selected and trained to promote reading to their classamtes and motivate our reluctant readers.

On Author Appreciation Day, our Primary 5 students share their individually written stories, their favourite authors and literature genres with the lower primary students. Reading Ambassadors would also promote storybooks written by various authors to encourage students to to borrow.

This programme  aims  to foster and develop our students’ love of reading, Primary 1 to Primary 4 students will do a research on a book character and they will start working on their costumes in advance.
