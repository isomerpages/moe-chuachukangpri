<h3><strong><u>Applied Learning Programme (ALP) @ CCKPS - Sustainabots</u></strong></h3>
<p></p>
<p><strong><u>Approach:</u></strong>
<br>The ALP at CCKPS focuses on teaching students computational thinking through
robotics to develop essential problem-solving skills, foster a deeper understanding
of how technology can be applied to real-world scenarios, and cultivate
future-ready competencies. Robotics serves as a hands-on, engaging way
for students to explore coding, automation, and technology through iterative
problem-solving and design thinking.</p>

<p></p>
<p>The Ask → Plan → Create → Improve framework is used to guide students
in critical thinking, creativity, and innovation. This structured approach
ensures that students learn to identify problems, plan solutions, prototype
ideas, and refine their designs through feedback and iteration.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Aligned with the theme of environmental sustainability, students will
apply robotics to tackle contemporary challenges. This integration encourages
innovation and ethical responsibility, empowering students to develop technological
solutions that contribute to a more sustainable future.</p>
