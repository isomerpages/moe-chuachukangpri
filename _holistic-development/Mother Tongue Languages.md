##### **Mother Tongue Language (MTL) Fortnight & Language and Cultural Camp**

The School Department will organise a variety of activities for the Mother Tongue Fortnight, an initiative from MOE for Mother Tongue Languages since 2011. MTL Fortnight provides a platform for students to actively learn MTL and the associated culture to experience MTL as ‘a living language. Students gain a deeper understanding of culture and heritage through hands-on activities such as drama, performances and storytelling.
