<p><strong>Learning for Life Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>The school’s <strong>Learning for Life Programme</strong> (Community Service
&amp; Leadership), introduced in 2014, aims to equip students with the <strong>values</strong>, <strong>attitudes</strong> and <strong>habits</strong> needed
to be <strong>personally and socially effective</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anchored in Stephen Covey’s 7 Habits, our student leadership programme
develops both <strong>intrapersonal and interpersonal skills</strong>, believing
that <strong>every student is a leader</strong>. Students learn personal
and social effectiveness through a structured curriculum and platforms
such as <strong>self-exploration</strong>, <strong>Grow in Values activities</strong>, <strong>recess activities</strong>, <strong>class projects </strong>and <strong>CCAs</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<br>The school also provides students with various <strong>Values in Action (VIA)</strong> opportunities
to <strong>give back to the community</strong> and<strong> apply their interpersonal values and skills.</strong>

<p><strong>CCKPS Student Leadership Framework</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>The CCKPS <strong>Student Leadership Framework</strong> is designed to help
every student grow into a confident and responsible leader. At the heart
of the framework is a <strong>caring and supportive school culture</strong>,
where students are encouraged to speak up, take initiative, and learn through
experience.
<br>
<br>The framework is guided by a clear <strong>vision</strong> and supported
by teachers who plan and guide learning experiences. These include <strong>Values in Action (VIA)</strong>,
school events, projects, learning journeys, and leadership training. Through
these experiences, students are given opportunities to share their ideas,
work with others, and take on leadership roles.
<br>
<br>Teachers support students by providing guidance and structure, while gradually
allowing students to plan, co-plan, and lead activities. This helps students
build confidence and take ownership of their learning and actions.
<br>
<br>The framework is also grounded in the <strong>7 Habits</strong> and <strong>E21CC skills</strong>,
which help students develop important life skills. These include self-management,
critical thinking, communication, teamwork, and respect for others.
<br>
<br>Through this structured approach, CCKPS aims to develop students who are
confident, caring, and ready to lead in school and beyond.</p>

<p><strong>Our Tiers of Leadership</strong>
<br>
<br>At CCKPS, we believe that<strong> every student is a leader</strong> who
has the capacity to make a positive difference. Leadership is not defined
by the size of a role or task; rather, it is reflected in everyday actions
that positively impact others. This belief forms the foundation of our
student leadership approach.
<br>
<br>Tier 1 Leadership focuses on school-defined and class-defined roles such
as Class Chairperson, Care Representative, Group Reps, Subject Reps, and
other class-appointed positions. These roles empower students to contribute
meaningfully to a positive and supportive classroom environment.
<br>
<br>Tier 2 Leadership comprises students entrusted with specific responsibilities
to support school-wide programmes and events. Working closely with teachers,
Tier 2 leaders assist in the planning and execution of key initiatives,
playing an important role in enriching the overall CCKPS experience for
the school community.
<br>
<br>At the highest level is the Tier 3 or School Executive Committee (Exco).
These student leaders are selected by department teachers in recognition
of their exemplary conduct and leadership qualities. Exco members actively
contribute to major school events such as National Education activities,
Staff Appreciation Day, and Values in Action programmes. They also support
the school in promoting positive conduct by modelling and reinforcing expected
behaviours. Entrusted with responsibility and authority, Exco members serve
the school with confidence, integrity, and commitment.</p>

<p><strong>Values in Action (VIA)</strong>
<br>
<br><strong>The Design Thinking Proces</strong>s underpins our Values-in-Action
(VIA) programmes, enabling students to empathise with the needs of others
and design meaningful, purposeful solutions. Through this people-centred
approach, students learn to apply creativity and critical thinking to address
real-world issues, nurturing empathy and social responsibility.</p>

<p></p>
<p>VIA serves as an important platform for the development of <strong>student agency,</strong> where
students are empowered with <strong>voice, choice, and ownership</strong> over
their learning. Through authentic service-learning experiences, students
take initiative, make informed decisions, and reflect on the impact of
their actions. In the process, they strengthen the <strong>7 Habits</strong> and
develop key <strong>emerging 21st-century competencies (e21CC)</strong> such
as collaboration, communication, critical and inventive thinking, and civic
literacy.
<br>
<br>Across all levels, VIA programmes integrate <strong>digital tools and digital literacy,</strong> equipping
students with essential digital competencies to research, collaborate,
design, and communicate effectively in meaningful contexts.
<br>
<br>At <strong>Primary 1 and 2</strong>, students focus on building a strong
foundation in <strong>empathy</strong> through age-appropriate VIA experiences
centred on <strong>Caring for Family and Friends</strong> and <strong>Understanding Friendships</strong>.
Through guided activities and reflections, students learn to recognise
emotions, show care and respect, and practise positive relationship-building
in their daily interactions.
<br>
<br>At <strong>Primary 3</strong>, students embark on their <strong>Integrated Project Work (IPW)</strong> journey,
where they experience interdisciplinary learning and apply knowledge and
skills to plan and implement their VIA projects.
<br>
<br>At <strong>Primary 4</strong>, students take on leadership and responsibility
as <strong>buddies to Primary 1 students</strong>. They support the induction
of P1 students into school life, care for them during recess in the first
few days of school, and model positive behaviours as responsible role models.
As part of their VIA programme this year, P4 students will design and create <strong>educational games</strong> to
teach P1 students about <strong>sustainability,</strong> applying the <strong>design thinking process</strong> to
create age-appropriate, engaging, and meaningful learning experiences.
<br>
<br>At <strong>Primary 5</strong>, students participate in an <strong>intergenerational VIA programme</strong> in
partnership with <strong>SportSG</strong>, engaging seniors at Active Ageing
Centres through playing and co-creating games that promote active ageing.
This programme fosters empathy, inclusivity, and meaningful intergenerational
connections.
<br>
<br>At <strong>Primary 6</strong>, students develop their own voice as advocates
for causes they believe in. They learn to research issues, articulate their
perspectives, and take action to raise awareness, emerging as confident
and values-driven advocates for positive change.
