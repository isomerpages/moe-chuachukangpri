<p>The school’s student leadership programme is anchored on Stephen Covey’s
7 Habits of Highly Effective People. With its focus on intrapersonal and
interpersonal skills, the 7 habits programme believes that every student
in the school is a leader and aims to mould each student to become personally
and socially effective for life. The school’s student leadership programme
provides its students with a structured curriculum that teach social effectiveness.
Opportunities are also given to students through their Values in Action
(VIA) activities for the application of inter-personal values and skills.
<br>
<br>The table below shows the Leadership Framework and lists the three tiers
of Student Leadership across the six levels.</p>
