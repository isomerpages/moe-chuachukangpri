##### **Vision**

Every Student, a Future-Ready and Responsible Digital Learner

##### **Objectives**

* To integrate the technology in curriculum, instruction and assessment.
* To nurture students to be self-directed, collaborative and responsible digital learners
* To build a culture of ICT collaboration and innovation in CCKPS

##### **E-Pedagogy Training**

Our school’s e-Pedagogy training aims to provide our students with the necessary ICT skills to support them in their learning and to prepare them for the future. These ICT skills are aligned to MOE’s revised Baseline standards (New Media Literacies) and are integrated in specific subjects so that students learn to apply them purposefully.

  

The ICT skill competencies are set out in progressive stages (Table 1). These represent the basic level of knowledge, skills and values that students need to benefit from a curriculum enriched with ICT, and eventually thrive in a technology-driven society.

##### Cyber Wellness Programme

<img src="/images/ICT6.png" 
     style="width:35%">



Our aim is to equip our students with skills and knowledge to become responsible and discerning digital learners, demonstrate respect for self and others and practise safe and responsible use of digital resources.

  

Student advocates share their understanding of Cyber Wellness issues through pre-assembly talks. Professional speakers engage our students through assembly talks on various Cyber Wellness topics. In the classroom, lessons on Cyber Wellness are carried out during the Form Teacher Guidance Period. Form Teachers conduct discussions on Cyber Wellness issues and how to go about navigating the cyber world.

  

The school also uses SLS to roll out Cyber Wellness lesson packages termly to all students to constantly engage them.
