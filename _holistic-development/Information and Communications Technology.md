##### **Vision**

Every Student, a Future-Ready and Responsible Digital Learner

##### **Objectives**

* To integrate the technology in curriculum, instruction and assessment.
* To nurture students to be self-directed, collaborative and responsible digital learners
* To build a culture of ICT collaboration and innovation in CCKPS

##### **E-Pedagogy Training**

Our school’s e-Pedagogy training aims to provide our students with the necessary ICT skills to support them in their learning and to prepare them for the future. These ICT skills are aligned to MOE’s revised Baseline standards (New Media Literacies) and are integrated in specific subjects so that students learn to apply them purposefully.

  

The ICT skill competencies are set out in progressive stages (Table 1). These represent the basic level of knowledge, skills and values that students need to benefit from a curriculum enriched with ICT, and eventually thrive in a technology-driven society.
