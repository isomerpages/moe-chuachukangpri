<h5><strong>Vision</strong></h5>
<p>Every Student, a Future-Ready and Responsible Digital Learner</p>
<h5><strong>Objectives</strong></h5>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>To integrate the technology in curriculum, instruction and assessment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To nurture students to be self-directed, collaborative and responsible
digital learners</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To build a culture of ICT collaboration and innovation in CCKPS</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>E-Pedagogy Training</strong></h5>
<p>Our school’s e-Pedagogy training aims to provide our students with the
necessary ICT skills to support them in their learning and to prepare them
for the future. These ICT skills are aligned to MOE’s revised Baseline
standards (New Media Literacies) and are integrated in specific subjects
so that students learn to apply them purposefully.</p>
<p>The ICT skill competencies are set out in progressive stages (Table 1).
These represent the basic level of knowledge, skills and values that students
need to benefit from a curriculum enriched with ICT, and eventually thrive
in a technology-driven society.</p>

</div>
<p>Our aim is to equip our students with skills and knowledge to become responsible
and discerning digital learners, demonstrate respect for self and others
and practise safe and responsible use of digital resources.</p>
<p>Student advocates share their understanding of Cyber Wellness issues through
pre-assembly talks. Professional speakers engage our students through assembly
talks on various Cyber Wellness topics. In the classroom, lessons on Cyber
Wellness are carried out during the Form Teacher Guidance Period. Form
Teachers conduct discussions on Cyber Wellness issues and how to go about
navigating the cyber world.</p>
<p>The school also uses SLS to roll out Cyber Wellness lesson packages termly
to all students to constantly engage them.</p>
