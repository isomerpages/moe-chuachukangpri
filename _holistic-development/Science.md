<h3><strong>Curricular Goal</strong></h3>
<h5><strong>Nurture a Community of Science Inquirers</strong></h5>
<p>Our school adopts an inquiry-based approach to the teaching and learning
of Science. Inquiry-based learning allows our students to make observations,
ask questions, think creatively and critically to investigate on a problem
and make connections to science concepts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our science curriculum provides our students with a range of learning
experiences in the form of scientific investigations, authentic learning
and learning journeys.</p>

<h5><strong>Environment Science Club</strong></h5>
<p>Members of the Environmental Science Club actively participate in a range
of experiments and activities centered around sustainability. They also
champion the cultivation of positive sustainable habits, particularly on
upcycling â€” an innovative practice that involves transforming old and used
materials into new, usable products.</p>

<h5><strong>Science Week</strong></h5>
<p>Science Week was organised to allow the learning of Science to take place
outside of their usual curriculum. Students got a chance to explore different
areas of Science using simple, everyday materials that they are normally
exposed to, like plasticine, toothpicks, aluminium foil, batteries, and
more! The activities are designed to show that even without prior knowledge
of Science, students can still find joy in Science through experimental
learning.</p>

<h5><strong>Hydroponics</strong></h5>
<p>Our Primary 3 students will have the opportunity to transplant and harvest
local vegetables such as Milk Cabbage and Chye Sim. This hands-on experience
allows students to witness the practical application of their classroom
knowledge as they observe the life cycle of the plants through the growth
of these vegetables.</p>
