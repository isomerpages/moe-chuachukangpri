### Aim of Physical Education

We aim to equip our students with the strong foundation in fundamental movement skills and core values for the leaning, participation and enjoyment of a wide variety of physical activities and sports.  Our students would be encouraged to participate in self-directed regular exercises as part of a healthy lifestyle.

  

  

### Purpose of Physical Education

The purpose of Physical Education is to enable our students to demonstrate individually and with others, the physical skills, practices and values to enjoy a lifetime of active, healthy living.

We consciously make us of movement as the primary medium to reach and teach the whole child through the following three modes:

* Education in movement
* Education through movement; and
* Education about movement

  

**Learning _in_ Movement**   
Physical education distinguishes itself by its primary focus on the body and physical skills.  It emphasises education in movement or the psychomotor domain.  Education in movement presents students with carefully selected physical activities that develop efficiency, effectiveness and versatility across various complex movement situations which the student will experience in school and in the future.

  

**Learning _through_ Movement**   
Physical education uses education through movement as an avenue for cognitive, affective and social development.  The outcomes of movement are not limited to the physical or simply the intrinsic part of the activity.  Therefore, the physical education programme develops in students the sufficient knowledge related to movement experiences which includes, movement concepts, principles and theories, game rules, tactics, and strategies, health- fitness-related benefits, the environmental risks and personal safety concerns.

Physical education provides an authentic setting for students to develop and practise the 21st Century Competencies, values and ideals, which support the development of character

  

**Learning _about_ Movement**   
Regular physical activity is necessary to develop and sustain optimal health and to attain desirable health-related fitness goals.  Education about movement addresses the value and benefits of a healthy lifestyle and a fit body.  Therefore, physical education encourages students to take deliberate actions to be involved in safe physical activities that help to develop health-related physical fitness and ultimately enjoy and value the benefits of daily physical activities.

  

### Beyond Classroom PE Programmes 

  

**Annual Sports Carnival / Lower Primary Sports Carnival**   
The Annual Sports Carnival, changed to Consortium Games Day due to the lack of facilities (PERI Upgrading) and the Lower Primary Sports Carnival are key events that garner a lot of excitement among students and teachers.  Students are given the opportunities to apply the various psychomotor skills which they have acquired during their PE lessons.  The changing of games rules promotes a safe and friendly environment for mass participation and promotes a strong sense of class bonding, school values and sportsmanship. 

  

**National Physical Fitness Award (NAPFA)**   
NAPFA is a tool that the school uses for students to measure their own physical fitness level: muscular strength and endurance, aerobic capacity, flexibility, agility, and body composition.

**Primary 5 Camp**   
The 3-day-2-night Primary 5 Cohort Camp is the highlight of the primary education our students have gone through with us.  This is their opportunity to apply the skills learnt in Outdoor Education modules and also the school values and the 7 Habits.  Through experiential learning, students learnt to apply all that they have learnt to work with one another through the various activities, resolve conflict and making sound decision for the group.  Adventure obstacle courses train our students to strengthen their resilience and not to give up when faced with challenges.  Students also learnt to encourage and help their classmates to give their best.  The experiences from the camp toughen our students’ mind and teach them valuable lessons outside the classrooms, and prepare them to be Future-Ready.
