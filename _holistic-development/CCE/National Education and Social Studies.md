#### **Vision**

Leaders who love Singapore and contribute towards building a Singapore for all.  

  

  

#### **Mission**

To prepare CCPKS leaders to be citizens of tomorrow by helping them to better understand the interconnectedness between Singapore and the world they live in and appreciate the experiences from the past to present. 

  

#### **National Education and Social Studies (NE-SS)**

The National Education and Social Studies (NE-SS) Committee comprises of two sections, National Education and Social Studies. 

National Education is part of holistic education. It aims to foster national cohesion, cultivate the instinct for survival as a nation and instill in our students confidence in our nation’s future. It also emphasises cultivating a sense of belonging and emotional rootedness to Singapore. 

The Social Studies curriculum aims to develop the civic competencies of our students by the end of a full course in Social Studies education. Civic competencies, which encompass the relevant knowledge about issues, critical and reflective thinking skills and values, will empower students to be informed, concerned and participative citizens for the world they live in. 

#### **C.A.R.E Approach to NE-SS**

In CCKPS, we engage our students in a Character-Attitude-Reflection-Engagement (C.A.R.E) approach. We believe that character is built through instructions so our Social Studies and Character & Citizenship Education curriculum are integrated with NE-focused lessons. 

Our students’ attitude is mold through experiences during the NE commemorative days. They are actively engage in discussions and reflections in creating meaning and identity of themselves as Singaporeans and as global citizens. 

Students will participate in V.I.A activities – to be active citizens who have a collective resolve and a sense of shared mission towards building a Singapore for all.
