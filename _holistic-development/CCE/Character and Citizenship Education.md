#### **Character Education**

In CCKPS, we believe that every child is a leader, a leader in the personal and social domains.  Students learn how to be an effective leader through The 7 Habits conducted during Form Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP). Values Education focusing on the 3I Approach (Immerse, Involve and Introspect) are also conducted during FTGP.

  

#### **Form Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP)**

The main objectives of FTGP are to provide for quality interaction time between Form Teachers and pupils, and to equip pupils with social and emotional (SE) competencies.

  

The lessons are designed for pupils to acquire skills that will help to:

a)      understand themselves better (self-awareness)   
b)      learn how to manage themselves (self-management)    
c)       understand their family and friends (social-awareness)   
d)      learn how to work with their family and friends (relationship management)    
e)      make appropriate and responsible decisions (responsible decision making)


During FTGP, 1-to-1 interaction is also carried out between the Form Teachers and the students, to allow the Form Teachers to have heart-to-heart conversations with each student to get to know each student better.

  

#### **Programmes & Activities**

**<u>Pre-assembly and Assembly Talks</u>**    
The pre-assembly and assembly talks aim to create a learning, thinking and reflecting environment for the students.  

  

**<u>Recess Activities</u>**     
The varied recess activities allow students to continue their learning beyond the classroom.  

  

**<u>Citizenship Education</u>**   
It aims to develop national cohesion, cultivate the instinct for survival as a nation and instill in our students, confidence in our nation’s future. It also emphasises on cultivating a sense of belonging and emotional rootedness to Singapore.

  

We do the above through our Social Studies syllabus and the 4 core events, which are Total Defence Day, International Friendship Day, Racial Harmony Day and National Day.
