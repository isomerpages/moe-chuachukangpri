Dear Alumni,

We regret to inform you that the school will not be opened for Teachers' Day visitation on 31 August this year.

The school will be closed in preparation of the Presidential Election 2023 after school dismissal at 10.30 a.m. that day.

You can share your appreciation via a short video clip and submit to Mr Yip ([yip_yew_wing@moe.edu.sg](yip_yew_wing@moe.edu.sg)) by 28 August. 

We thank you for your support and appreciation for your teachers.
