<p>Dear Parents,</p>
<p>Starting from February 2025, school uniforms will no longer be available
for purchase through the school bookshop. This change is due to the supplierâ€™s
broader business considerations that have affected our current sale arrangement
with them.</p>
<p>To ensure that uniform prices remain the same and accessible, we have
made alternative arrangements on the mode of purchase. You now have three
options to purchase uniforms.</p>
<p>You can purchase:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>from the school canteen on <strong>Fridays </strong>of the <strong>first </strong>and <strong>third week of each month from 2pm to 4pm.</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>online through the supplier's website at <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://shanghai-uniforms.com</a>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>directly at the supplier's warehouse located at
<br>
</p>
<p>Shanghai School Uniforms Pte Ltd
<br>63 Ubi Ave 1 #04-09 Singapore 408937
<br>Tel : 6352 2741 DID: 8322 0539
<br>Operating hours: Mon-Fri: 9.30am to 6pm (1-2pm lunch)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p></p>
