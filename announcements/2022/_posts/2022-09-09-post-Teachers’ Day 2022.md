Dear Alumni, 

CCKPS is celebrating Teachers’ Day on Thursday,  1 September 2022, from 7.30 am. to 10.30 a.m.

As discussed at the recent alumni meeting, active senior and junior alumni who have been attending the alumni meetings and activities are given the privilege to visit your ex-teachers at the school canteen from 11.00 am. to 12.00 pm. on that day. 

However, please make your appointment with the teachers you would like to meet through Mr Yip at [yip\_yew\_wing@schools.gov.sg](mailto:yip_yew_wing@schools.gov.sg) by Monday, 8 August 2022.  

A confirmation reply from us by Friday, 19 August 2022 is to be presented to the Security Officer as proof of entry.

Thank you and stay safe!
