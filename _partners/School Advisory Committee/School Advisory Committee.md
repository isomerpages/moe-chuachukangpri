<h4><strong><u>Introduction</u></strong></h4>
<p></p>
<p>The School Advisory Committee (SAC) reflects the Ministry of Education’s
commitment to strong school-community partnerships. It provides a platform
for citizens and permanent residents to support MOE education policies,
collaborate with the school to enhance student learning and school effectiveness,
and help achieve the Desired Outcomes of Education. SAC members contribute
their expertise and perspectives to promote school excellence and holistic
student development.</p>

<h4><strong><u>School-Industry Partnership</u></strong></h4>
<p>With the support of our Vice Chairperson, Ms Cindy Chng, Chua Chu Kang
Primary School has established a meaningful industry partnership with Merck
Sharp &amp; Dohme (MSD).
<br>To equip our students with future-ready skills and competencies, the school
collaborated with MSD’s Translational Medicine Research Centre in Singapore.
This enriching partnership offered our students an eye-opening experience,
fostering a deeper understanding and appreciation of science while highlighting
the key skillsets required to succeed in a global biopharmaceutical company.</p>

<p>In addition, in 2025, CCKPS key personnel embarked on a leadership learning
journey to MSD’s headquarters, where they gained valuable insights into
HR best practices through engaging team-building activities. We look forward
to this continued partnership with MSD.</p>
