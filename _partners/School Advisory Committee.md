<p>School-Industry Partnership</p>
<p>With the support of our Vice Chairperson, Ms Cindy Chng, Chua Chu Kang
Primary School has established a meaningful industry partnership with Merck
Sharp &amp; Dohme (MSD).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To equip our students with future-ready skills and competencies, the school
collaborated with MSD’s Translational Medicine Research Centre in Singapore.
This enriching partnership offered our students an eye-opening experience,
fostering a deeper understanding and appreciation of science while highlighting
the key skillsets required to succeed in a global biopharmaceutical company.</p>

<p>In addition, in 2025, CCKPS key personnel embarked on a leadership learning
journey to MSD’s headquarters, where they gained valuable insights into
HR best practices through engaging team-building activities. We look forward
to this continued partnership with MSD.</p>
