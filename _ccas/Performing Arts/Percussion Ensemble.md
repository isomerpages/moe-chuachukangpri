<p>Percussion Ensemble aims to equip our students with the essential and
fundamental percussion techniques for common percussion instruments such
as drums, xylophones, marimba, vibraphone etc.</p>
<p>Students will learn various music skills such as music literacy, aural
awareness and ensemble playing. As we value our students’ growth as young
musicians, performance exposure and experiences are vital.</p>
<p>Students will gain performance experiences through in-house school performances
(Aesthetic Assembly, National Day and Achiever’s Day) and external performances
like SYF. As they venture into advanced level of music learning, students’
perspectives will be broadened through cultural music appreciation and
learning about various percussion genres.</p>
<p>Lastly, this CCA focuses on laying the music foundation for our students
and preparing them for post-primary higher music education through various
Direct School Admission (DSA) such as CCA, Music Elective Programme (MEP)
and School of the Arts (SOTA), providing them with greater opportunities
to continue their musical journey.</p>
