<p>Percussion Ensemble is a new CCA here In CCKPS. The CCA aims to equip
our students with the essential and fundamental percussion techniques for
common percussion instruments such as drums, xylophones, marimba, vibraphone
etc. Students will learn various music skills such as music literacy, aural
awareness and ensemble playing. As we value our students’ growth as young
musicians, performance exposure and experiences are vital. Students will
gain performance experiences through in-house school performances (Aesthetic
Day, School concerts) and external performances like SYF. As they venture
into more serious music learning, students’ perspective will be broadened
through cultural music appreciation and learning about various percussion
genres.</p>
<p>Lastly, this CCA focuses on laying the music foundation for our students
and prepare them for post-primary higher music education through various
Direct School Admission (DSA) such as CCA, Music Elective Programme (MEP)
and School of the Arts (SOTA), providing them with greater opportunities
to continue their musical journey.</p>
