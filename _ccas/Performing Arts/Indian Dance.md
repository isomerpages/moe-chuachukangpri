<p>Our students learn various Indian dance forms such as classical, folk
and contemporary under the guidance of the CCA teachers and our dance instructor.
Elements of the skills include various Indian dance facial expressions,
hand and foot work, poise and stage presence. They will be introduced to
both Indian semi-classical and folk dance music genres. Our students develop
self-confidence and improve their social skills as they work as a team
during the CCA practice sessions. Our aspiring dancers showcase their talents
and skills during school events, participate in the Singapore Youth Festival
Arts Presentation as well as performing during community events.</p>
