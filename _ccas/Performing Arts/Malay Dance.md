<p>The Malay Dance Club provides an opportunity for our students to develop
their aesthetic skills and provides an avenue to learn more about the Malay
culture through dance. Malay Dance also instills discipline, confidence
and a sense of responsibility in the our students.&nbsp; Various platforms
were given to our students to showcase their talent such as performing
for school and external events as well as at National level, SYF. With
these platforms given, our students will develop their self-confidence
and leadership skills.</p>
