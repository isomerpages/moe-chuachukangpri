Percussion Ensemble is a new CCA here In CCKPS. The CCA aims to equip our students with the essential and fundamental percussion techniques for common percussion instruments such as drums, xylophones, marimba, vibraphone etc. Students will learn various music skills such as music literacy, aural awareness and ensemble playing. As we value our students’ growth as young musicians, performance exposure and experiences are vital. Students will gain performance experiences through in-house school performances (Aesthetic Day, School concerts) and external performances like SYF. As they venture into more serious music learning, students’ perspective will be broadened through cultural music appreciation and learning about various percussion genres.

Lastly, this CCA focuses on laying the music foundation for our students and prepare them for post-primary higher music education through various Direct School Admission (DSA) such as CCA, Music Elective Programme (MEP) and School of the Arts (SOTA), providing them with greater opportunities to continue their musical journey.
