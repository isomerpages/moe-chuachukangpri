<p>Art Club provides students with opportunities to explore visual arts through
hands-on experiences, creative thinking, and collaborative projects. Students
develop skills in drawing, painting, sculpture, mixed media, and digital
art while learning to express ideas and emotions visually.
<br>The CCA nurtures creativity, perseverance, and confidence as students
experiment with materials and techniques. Anchored in school values, Art
Club also exposes students to art as a means of communication and social
awareness through projects such as murals, sustainability-themed artworks,
and community-based art.
<br>Through structured guidance and authentic art-making experiences, students
grow as reflective learners who appreciate art, culture, and their role
in society.</p>
