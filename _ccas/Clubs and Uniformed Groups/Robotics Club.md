Beginning 2019, the Robotics Club merged with ICT Club. The merger is due to some duplication of skills being taught in ICT and Robotics Club. The merger resulted in bigger pool of students to participate in various competitions.     
  
Robotics Club seeks to equip our students with a variety of technological skills like :  
*   ICT – Photoshop, Newsmaker, Scratch Programming
*   Robotics – Robot construction, Programming with Scratch and EV3
*   Maker – Making of digital product with Microbit  

  

Our students in Robotics Club will learn :  
*   Intermediate to advance level programming of software languages.
*   Develop creative thinking by creating original works using technology.         
*   Assemble and programme robots or to programme to solve a problem to perform a variety of tasks and missions
